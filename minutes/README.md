## STATUS
We have currently only uploaded the metadata-file decribing the City Council Minutes 1867-1940.
The data-content of the City Council Minutes will be available in the beginning of March.

## ROADMAP
In parallel with the annual exspiration of privacy restrictions we will upload the City Counsil Minutes from that year.
Furthermore we aim to upload a lot of transcribed Parish Counsil Minutes, but we'll see.
